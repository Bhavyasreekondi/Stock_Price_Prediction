# Data Warehouse Lab 1

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is Data Warehouse Lab 1 where we're building a cool stock price prediction system. 

Think of it as a smart assistant that watches Google and Microsoft stocks, learns from their past behavior, and tries to predict what might happen next week. Pretty neat, right?

## What We're Building

We're creating an automated system that:
- Grabs stock data from the internet (Google & Microsoft)
- Stores it safely in Snowflake (our data warehouse)
- Uses machine learning to predict future prices
- Runs everything automatically with Airflow

## Files You'll Need

```
Stock_Price_Prediction/
â”œâ”€â”€ etl_pipeline.py          # Gets the stock data and puts it in Snowflake
â”œâ”€â”€ forecast_pipeline.py     # Makes predictions using ML
â”œâ”€â”€ credentials_setup.md     # How to set up your Snowflake account
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python packages needed
```

## Getting Started

1. Set up your Snowflake credentials (check `credentials_setup.md`)
2. Install the Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Copy the pipeline files to your Airflow setup
4. Let it run and watch the magic happen! âœ¨

That's it! The system will automatically fetch data daily and make predictions for the next 7 days. Pretty straightforward once you get your Snowflake account connected.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
